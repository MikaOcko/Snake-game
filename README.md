# Snake retro game
This project is a modern version of the mobile game “Snake”. This mythical game from the 90s was playable on the *unbreakable* **Nokia 3310** cell phone. This project offers a more modern version in a retro gaming spirit, developed using only **html, css and javascript.** languages.
